# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation — K-Means Clustering

## 📘 Overview
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment retail customers based on purchase history and spending behavior. It helps businesses understand customer segments for targeted marketing.

## 🧠 Objective
To automatically group customers with similar purchasing behaviors and aid marketing strategies using unsupervised learning.

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset used: [Customer Segmentation Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

Features include:
- Annual income  
- Spending score  
- Age  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data import and exploration  
2. Feature scaling and outlier analysis  
3. Use of the elbow method to determine optimal clusters  
4. K-Means model training  
5. Cluster visualization using 2D and 3D plots  

## 📈 Results
- Optimal number of clusters: 5  
- Achieved meaningful groups representing low, average, and high-value customers  

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Incorporate demographics and transaction frequency  
- Test other clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
